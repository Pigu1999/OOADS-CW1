The algorithm I have used for determining if two places are connected by a path with charging station is the Depth First Preorder
Traversal. This algorithm first visits the node it is currently at, then it visits the left subtree and then the right subtree.
I have set it so that it can only visit nodes that have a charging station (unless it's the final vertex). Depth First Preorder
Traversal has a worst case time complexity of O(v+e). This is because it will only visit each vertex once and only explore its edges
once while there, so if it's the worst case and the final vertex is where the destination is then it would only have visited each
vertex and edge once.
